REMEMBER KEEP THIS SIMPLE THEN APPLY MORE COMPLEXITY

Let's keep this simple
For UAM from our literature review, we need to consider the following:
- We will have lateral and vertical passing lanes
- We will assume that we are assigned a corridor from a 
    Universal Service Supplier and a passing lane to navigate through traffic
- Our agent needs has an action space of the following:
    - Stay on lateral lane
    - Get to the lateral passing zone 
    - Stay on the vertical lane 
    - Get to the vertical passing zone
    - Stay on lateral lane and get to the vertical passing zone
    - Stay on vertical lane and get to the lateral passing zone
